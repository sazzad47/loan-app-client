you all by certified maa (receipts enclosed) requesting that you remove inaccurate information from my file

According. I can show a judge that these accounts are inaccurate and that you violated the Fair Credit	
Reporting Act by ignoring my requests to investigate the items. My previous letters (all sent by certified

If this final request does not prompt you to conduct a proper investigation of these accounts in question,

Re: {dispute_item_and_explanation}  [Manually modify this line when you're in the final step of the dispute wizard (editor page)]

To Whom It May Concern:

I am concerned about the validity and accuracy of your recent investigation of these accounts that are reporting on my credit report. Last month I requested an investigation because I felt the item was not being reported legally. Couple of days ago I received a letter stating that your investigation was complete. Please explain to me how you conducted your investigation!

     1.Please explain to me what your representatives uncovered to lead them to believe that you are reporting this item as it
        legally should be reported?
     2.What certified documents were reviewed to conclude your investigation?
     3.Please provide a complete copy of all of the information that was transmitted to the data furnisher as part of the investigation.
     4.What did it cost your company to obtain the documents needed to complete your investigation? 
     5.Please provide proof of your timely procurement of certified documents.
     6.Did you speak directly to any agent of the company that was reporting the information to confirm the accuracy of what you are reporting?
     7.If yes to above:
          a.Who did you speak to? 
          b.On what date?
          c.How long was the conversation?
          d.What was their position?
          e.What telephone number did you call?
          f. What is the name of the employee of your company that spoke directly to the above party?
          g.What is the position of the employee of your company that spoke directly to the above party?
          h.How long has that employee been employed by your company?
          i.What formal training was provided to this employee to investigate items of this kind?
          j.Was there any e-mail or written communication between members of your company and the above party?
      8.If so, please provide copies of all correspondence; supply copies of any and all conclusive documentation to prove that
         you have in fact conducted a reasonable investigation of the account in question.
      9.Provide the date of the commencement of delinquency
     10.Provide the SPECIFIC date reporting that these items will cease

Enclosed with your response to the above questions I respectfully request a notarized affidavit confirming the information that is provided is true and correct as per my civil rights granted under several federal laws. This information should not come as a form letter response.

My initial dispute was detailed and directly related to the account in question. A template response will not be an acceptable response. If you cannot supply ALL of the above information in a timely manner as detailed in several laws, including but not limited to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I must immediately demand the permanent removal of this item from my credit report.

This erroneous entry is detrimental to my overall credit rating and has caused me severe financial and emotional distress. If you choose not to provide the above requested deletion or requested/required documentation of your investigation, I will pursue the enforcements of 
my constitutional rights via federal court proceedings. As you are well aware this information will come out through my formal discovery process, and necessary depositions. I have recently studied constitutional consumer protection laws along with civil/federal court procedures. I will represent myself pro-se and will formally request a jury trial.

Please respond accordingly,

My offer is to pay you (amount you are offering) in exchange for the dismissal so that we have both gained

Dear Sir,

i am aware of the money due you and of the judgment placed against me for this money. | had every
intention of taking care of this prior to the entry of the judgment, but unfortunately time constraints ended
that chance.

Today i am writing to you so that we may put this matter behind us and settle out this judgment for good,
under a few conditions. This will save you time and money trying to collect the judgment and will help me
recover from your negative entry against me.

i have been offered an amount from a close family member to pay you S(AMOUNT) to settle the debt in full
and have the judgment dismissed.

As the judgment creditor, you reserve the right to dismiss or vacate the judgment as well as entering it If |
pay you from this offer letter saving you immense time, fees and paperwork. you can then file a simple
paper with the courts dismissing the judgment

My offer is to pay you in exchange for the dismissal so that we have both gained something from this
unfortunate situation. It is extremely important that you dismiss the judgment rather than satisfying it,
because a satisfied judgment really looks no better for me than a filed judgment

With a dismissed judgment | can justify paying you. Upon your signed approval of this offer, | will forward
the full settlement to you immediately. | understand this offer is void if i do not send you S(AMOUNT) within
5-10 days of your signed confirmation

if you agree to ""dismiss"" the judgment upon full and final payment of S(AMOUNT), then please sign and
retum this offer and acceptance.

Offer Accepted and Agreed,

wonderful your service has always been.

Unfortunately, 2 years ago, I was in a financial dilemma due to (job loss, health issues, new baby, efc ). As
aresult 3 of my payments to you were delayed. Because your account with me is extremely important I
managed to borrow the money to cover the late payments. I paid those payments 30 days late on three
occasions over a nine-month period but | made sure to fulfill my obligation to ensure that your company
suffered no loss.

I am thankful and appreciative for the years of positive credit history that I have obtained through your
company but now those 3 late marks on my credit reports are causing me tremendous stress. I am trying
to move up to a better paid position at my work, but the negative remarks are hurting my efforts.

This is where my ""Goodwill Request” comes in. I desperately need this promotion and I would be

bureaus to remove those entries.

Dear Collection Manager:

It has come to my attention, through my credit report, that you claim I owe a debt to your agency. I can
save us both some effort and time by settiing the debt out.

Here below is my offer. This is not a renewed promise to pay, nor does it constitute any agreement unless
you sign and retum it.

Please Note that I have not yet agreed that this debt is indeed mine and I have the option to seek
additional proof of this debt from your agency.

Because you hold all the rights to report the debt to the credit bureaus as you see fit, you can certainly
change that listing at any time as the source reporting the debt.

I have no doubt that you are aware of my right to dispute this debt and request full proof of obligation.
Paying this unverified debt to you has little value to me if we cannot mutually agree that you will report the
debt as outlined below.
‘While I realize that your function is to collect debts as a collection agent, I am also aware that a paid
collection would not be favorable on my report. That being said, I have determined, through the bureaus,
that you have the absolute right to report this debt as you see fit or not report it at all.

If you indicate that you are unable to remove the negative listing on my credit report, I will be forced to
cease communication and request full verification of the debt.
My goal is to arrange a term that is acceptable to us both, since this debt is ""questionable ""

My Offer: I will pay your company the amount of $xx as “payment in full for the full satisfaction of this
account "" Upon receipt of the above payment, your company will agree to change this entry on my credit
reports to “Paid"" immediately. You further agree to remove any and all previous notations of delinquency.

If you approve and agree to these terms, please acknowledge with your signature and return this letter to
me. You agree these terms herein are confidential and that you have the authority to make such decisions.
No payment will be made without written confirmation.

Upon receipt of this signed acknowledgment, I will immediately mail you funds by priority mail. This is not a
renewed promise to pay but rather a restricted offer only. If no terms can be met, no new arrangements will
be made, and the offer will be withdrawn.

Dear Collection Manager:

have never had the debt verified to me as legitimate by your agency, I may be willing to save us both some
time and effort by ""settiing the debt out™ with restrictions.

I understand that you hold all the rights to report the debt to the credit bureaus as you see fit and you can
change that listing at any time, as the source owning the debt. I am sure you are aware of my right to
dispute this debt and to request full proof of the obligation as per the FDCPA. Paying this unverified debt
means little to me if we cannot mutually agree that you will report the debt as mentioned below.

‘While I realize that your purpose is to collect debts as a collection agent, I am also aware of what a paid
collection on my report would represent for me, which is not favorable. That being said, I know that you

false information but you may remove a listing any time at your discretion.

Please do not attempt to continue contacting me outside of this offer or I will be forced to cease and desist
‘our communication and request full lengthy verification of the debt. My goal is to arrange a term
acceptable to both.

My financial resources are limited and I am trying to do what's right but I am realistic about my financial
ability. I will pay your company the amount of S(AMOUNT) as ""payment in full” for this account. Upon
receipt of the above payment, your company has agreed to delete the item on my credit reports.
If you agree with these terms please acknowledge this letter with your signature and return it to me. You
agree that the terms herein are confidential and that you have the authority to make such decisions. No
payment will be made without written confirmation from you.

Upon receipt of this signed acknowledgment, I will immediately mail you a cashier's check by priority mail.
This is not a renewed promise to pay but rather a restricted offer only. If no terms can be met, no new
arrangements will be made and the offer will be void.

To Whom it May Concern,

According to my most recent credit report, your company is currently reporting to the three credit bureaus
that I applied for credit with your organization. I did not grant you authorization to review my credit report.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that a creditor be able to verify the written authorization of the
consumer giving the creditor permission to review their credit. If you can provide a copy of a credit
application authorizing the disclosure of my credit files with my signature, I will accept the inquiry. If a
signed authorization cannot be found please remove the inquiry from the three main credit bureaus.

The presence of this inquiry is adversely affecting my credit report and is impeding my ability to obtain
necessary credit. Time is of the essence so I would greatly appreciate a response from you within thirty
(30) days.

Please mail me the copy of the signed application or a letter indicating your intention to delete the inquiry.

Specifically, violations are: (List all violations: called late at night, refused to allow you to validate it, told
other third parties about your debt, left harassing telephone messages, refused to provide proof, harassed
or intimidated you, etc. Be sure to include any proof you have).

I am aware that | had an outstanding debt with your company but I refuse to make any arrangements with
a collection agency, particularly one that does not respect my rights. Now that they have violated the
FDCPA, I am requesting to communicate directly with you, otherwise | may be forced to take legal action
against this collection agency that represents you.

Please reply by mail to advise me if you will take the account back so that I may make arrangements with
you. Upon receiving your reply I will immediately contact you.
I have forwarded a copy of this letter to the collection agency and I am including a cease and desist clause
directed towards that agency. From this moment forward I will only correspond with you.
I await your reply. Upon receiving it, I will write back to you via certified mail.

Specifically you: [list all that apply]

- Failed to validate a debt at my request- FDCPA violation

- Continued to report a disputed debt to the CRA- FCRA violation

- Continued to attempt to collect a disputed debt- FDCPA violation

- Ignored my cease and desist- FDCPA violation

Not only have you ignored my prior requests for validation of debt (see enclosed copies of receipts letters)
but you also continue to report this debt to the credit bureaus causing damage to my character. This letter
will again request that you follow guidelines of The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15US.C.
§ 1692 and please provide the following:

Validation of Debt Request

- Proof of your right to own/collect this alleged debt -Balance claimed including all fees, interest and
penalties

-Contract bearing my personal signature -License proof to collect debts in my state

As you certainly are aware, ""Admission by Silence” means that you had a legal duty to defend your
position but failed to do so and if my claims were untrue you would have been compelled to deny my
charges. I will use the Admission by Silence in my defense should | be summoned to court or take action

I expect to receive proof requested above, within 15 days of this letter. Should you continue to ignore my
request for this validation of debt I reserve the right to sue your company for violations of my consumer
rights as indicated under both the FDCPA and the FCRA. I may also seek damages from you if warranted.

In a good faith effort to resolve the matter amicably, I must demand proof of this debt, specifically the

Absent such proof, you must correct any erroneous reports of this past debt as mine.

I am writing to request that you please provide the following information:

1. Please evidence your authorization under 15 USC 1692(e) and 15 USC 1692(f) in this alleged matter.

2. What is your authorization of law for your collection of information?

3. What is your authorization of law for your collection of this alleged debt?

4. Please evidence your authorization to do business or operate in this state.

5. Please evidence proof of the alleged debt, including the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. 

6. Please provide a complete account history, including any charges added for collection activity.

‘You have thirty (30) days from receipt of this notice to respond. Failure to respond in writing, hand-signed,

maintain reasonable procedures in your operations to assure maximum possible accuracy in the credit
reports you publish.

Credit reporting laws ensure that bureaus report only 100% accurate credit information. Every step must
be taken to assure the information reported is completely accurate and correct.

The following information therefore needs to be re-investigated:

{dispute_item_and_explanation}

I respectfully request to be provided proof of this alleged item, specifically the contract, note or other
instrument bearing my signature. Failing that, the item must be deleted from the report as soon as

who have received a copy within the last six months, or the last two years for employment purposes.
Additionally, please provide the name, address, and telephone number of each credit grantor or other
subscriber.

Under federal law, you have thirty (30) days to complete your re-investigation. Be advised that the
description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information is
hereby requested as well, to be provided within fifteen (15) days of the completion of your re-investigation.

Re: Acct # {account_number}

To Whom It May Concern:

I.am sending this letter to you in response to the notice I received from you on (date of letter). Please be
advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act, 15 USC 16929 Sec. 809 (b) that your claim is disputed and validation is requested.

This is NOT a request for ‘verification’ or proof of my mailing address, but a request for 'VALIDATION'
made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your office provide me
with factual evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you.

Please provide me with the following:

-What the money you say I owe is for;

-Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe;

-Provide me with copies of any papers that show | agreed to pay what you say I owe;

-Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable;
-Identify the original creditor;
-Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account;
-Show me that you are licensed to collect in my state; and

-Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent.

If your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the three major Credit Bureau's (Equifax,
Experian or TransUnion), said action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to
this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that
you represent I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following:

-Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act

-Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act

-Defamation of Character

If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested, I will require at least 30 days to
investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist.

Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my
credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel. This includes any information to a credit reporting
repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate when in fact there is
no provided proof that it is.

If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all
references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such
deletion request shall be sent to me immediately.
I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your offices to my home or to
my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not
limited to computer generated calls or correspondence sent to any third parties, it will be considered
harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in
writing and sent to the address noted in this letter.

This is an attempt to correct your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.

I am in receipt of your letter claiming that I owe your company for a debt. According to the Federal Fair

I have to date, received no proof that I owe your company any debt and I am requesting that you forward
to me full and proper documentation as evidence of this alleged debt. As per the FDCPA, it is a violation
for any debt collector to pursue collection activity on an account without notifying the debtor in writing
within 5 days after any communication. Additionally I am allowed 30 days to dispute the validity of the
debt. If you are unable to provide me with proper proof then you must stop attempting to collect this
alleged debt.

If you continue to claim I owe a debt that you cannot confirm with proof then you will be in direct violation
of the FDCPA_ Additionally, any attempt on your part to report this alleged debt to my credit reports will be
a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Please forward your documentation to me upon receipt of this certified letter. Please note that proper
documentation is not a print out or bill from you but rather actual proof of the debt's existence.

16929 Sec. 809 (8), stating your claim is disputed and validation is requested.

This is NOT a request for “verification” or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION
made pursuant to the above named Titie and Section. I respectfully request your offices provide me with
‘competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you.

At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3

your client for the following:

Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act

Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act

Defamation of Character

If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested in the following Declaration, I will
require at least 30 days to investigate this information, during which time all collection activity must cease
and desist. Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental
to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes any listing of any
information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated. If your office fails to
respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this
account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request
shall be sent to me immediately.

(OPTIONAL CEASE & DESIST) I would also like to request, in writing, that no further telephone contact be
made by your offices to my home or to my place of employment. If your offices continue to attempt
telephone communication with me it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file
suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this

‘am requesting validation of the alleged debt I am aware that there is a debt from [name of doctor, hospital,
clinic, etc] but I am unaware of the amount due and your bill does not include a detailed breakdown of any
fees.

Furthermore, I am allowed under the HIPAA law (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996) to protect my privacy and medical records from third parties. I do not recall giving permission to
[name of provider] for them to release my medical information to a third party. I understand that the HIPAA
does allow for limited information about me but any details may only be revealed with the patients
authorization, therefore my request is twofold and as follows:

Validation of Debt and HIPAA authorization

- Please provide a breakdown of fees including any and all collection costs and medical charges

- Please provide a copy of my signature with the provider of service to release my medical information to
you

- Immediately cease any credit bureau reporting until debt has been validated by me

Please send this information to my address listed above and accept this letter, sent certified mail, as my
formal debt validation request, of which I am allowed under the FDCPA.

Please note that withholding the information you received from any medical provider in an attempt to be
HIPAA compliant will be a violation of the FDCPA because you will be deceiving me after my written
request. I am requesting full documentation of what you received from the provider of service in
connection with this alleged debt.

Furthermore, any reporting of this debt to the credit bureaus prior to allowing me to validate it may be a
violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which can allow me to seek damages from a collection agent.
I await your reply with the above requested proof. Upon receiving it, I will correspond back with you by

RE: Account number {account_number}

To Whom It May Concern,

Please be advised that you are attempting to collect on an expired debt. I am invoking my right to cease
you, based on factual law that this debt in question is legally expired under the Statute of Limitations.
Accordingly, I am requesting that you do not attempt to collect this expired debt, and should you seek legal
recourse I will invoke my right of the expired statute as a valid defense.

Additionally any attempts to harm my credit rating by updating or changing dates after you have been
informed that the debt is expired, are a direct violation of the FDCPA.

Any abuse to my credit rating on your part will be met with all recourse available to me.

I am aware of how long items may remain on my credit reports and any attempt to extend the reporting
time will be investigated by me, and reported to the American Collectors Association and my State
Attorney General.
I am completely aware of how long the debt is legally collectable and how long it is legally reportable. I
realize a debt is allowed to be reported to my credit for 7 years, and my research has shown me that often
a collection agency will reset the date of original charge off to the date they purchased it, thus trying to
extend the reporting time in an attempt to force a consumer into paying it. I am informing you of this
knowiledge so that you may do the right thing.
I have no intention of renewing the expired statute of limitations, so please stop wasting your time
contacting me.

I expect this will be the last time I hear from you.

Re: {account_number}
To Whom It May Concern,
Please be apprised that you are in direct violation of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. In my opinion
you have violated at least three sections of this act by:

« Failing to validate a debt as allowed to the debtor under 15 USC 1692 (g) Section 809 (b)

« Communicating with a debtor after receiving a cease and desist certified mail under 15 USC 1692
(g) Section 805 (c)
« Harassment of alleged debtor under the ""abuse & harassment” subsection of the statute, USC 1692
(g) Section 806 (5)

I have complete and thorough records of your violations and I am prepared to protect myself and my rights
from unscrupulous collection agencies.
In (EXACT DATE), I sent by certified mail (receipt number: (CERTIFIED MAIL RECEIPT NUMBER), a
request for your office to provide me with proof and evidence of the debt you alleged I owed, and I did so
within 30 days of receiving your first notice. In that same letter I also included my cease and desist
instructions.

After verified delivery of my letter (via your office’s signature), you proceeded to mail a simple bill which is
NOT considered a ""validation of debt” by any means. You may wish to familiarize yourself with what is
required when validating a debt.
Your office also proceeded to contact me by phone after the delivery and acceptance of my certified letter.
Contacting a person after a cease and desist can lead to serious trouble for your agency including
damages of up to $1000.00 per incident.

I highly doubt that this S(ENTER AMOUNT OF DEBT) debt is worth your agency’s license and the fees
and penalties for violations of the FDCPA.

There is no question that you willfully violated my rights and that I could bring charges against you
immediately. However, I am assuming this has been a terrible mistake on your part and that you will take
appropriate steps to enlighten yourself and your staff of such dangerous actions.

I will also be checking my credit report to see if you have willfully reported an unverified and disputable
debt to the credit bureaus. If so, that will be a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I will state again in
this certified mailing that you have failed to verify the debt as accurate, you have provided no proof of this
alleged debt, and I must remind you again to not contact me in any way via phone or mail in reference to
collecting this debt.

If I receive anything other than absolute proof from you, provided by the original creditor, I will assume you
are harassing me and ignoring my cease and desist, and I will take action against you for these continued
violations and abuse.

Sincerely,

{client_signature}

Re: {account_number}
To Whom It May Concern,
In reviewing my credit reports, | came across a debt item that was listed incorrectly. | disputed this account
1o the credit bureaus and they confirmed it was verified as accurate by you. 
| am aware of the rights | have and am requesting that you immediately remove the debt from my credit
reports or you may face damages by reporting inaccurate data to a credit reporting agency. (See the 3
FCRA) This debt is listed as a charge off, with a last date of activityof ___________ You are reporting 
the charge off date as the date you purchased the debt instead of the actual charge off date. This is a 
clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as it is clearly stated that “no debt may be reported to a 
consumers’ credit file for any longer than 7 years from the date of first serious delinquency or charge off *
Because you have altered the charge off date as the date you purchased it, you are committing fraud. I
have informed the credit bureaus of this, and have asked for a second verification. When that verification 
comes to you, I suggest you follow the law and report the true facts. In addition to this debt being over the 
allowed time to report (7 years) it has also passed the statute of limitations to collect I have no intention of
paying this old expired debt and | am informing you of this now.
Should you attempt to report or collect this expired debt, I will contact my Attorney General and fill out a
complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, and I will take steps to collect damages from you of up to
$1.000.00. I believe | have a case against you for violating sections of the FDCPA and FCRA should you
continue.

In addition, under the provisions of state and federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), Fair

collection of the debt while efforts are made to obtain verification. Until you resolve this error with the
creditor, you should neither contact me nor anyone else except the creditor about this collection.
Furthermore, any reporting of this matter to credit reporting agencies is premature. Until you have
investigated my dispute, you should not relay negative information to a credit reporting agency. If negative
information has already been reported, you must notify the agency to remove said report until the
investigative process is over so that my credit report remains accurate, or at the very least, my credit
report should be updated to reflect my dispute.
‘Your next contact with me should be to either notice that the creditor has failed to provide verification of the
debt and that the matter has been closed or that you believe that this debt is valid and are providing proof 
of my responsibility. If the former, please confirm that I am not being held responsible for the debt in writing
and also that if the account has already been noted on my credit report, that you wiill contact the bureau(s) I

Dear Sir,

I am aware of the money due you and of the judgment placed against me for this money. I had every
intention of taking care of this prior to the entry of the judgment, but unfortunately time constraints ended
that chance.

Today I am writing to you so that we may put this matter behind us and settle out this judgment for good,
under a few conditions. This will save you time and money trying to collect the judgment and will help me
recover from your negative entry against me.

I have been offered an amount from a close family member to pay you S(AMOUNT) to settle the debt in full and have the judgment dismissed. 

As the judgment creditor, you reserve the right to dismiss or vacate the judgment as well as entering it. If I pay you from this offer letter saving you immense time, fees and paperwork, you can then file a simple paper with the courts dismissing the judgment.
With a dismissed judgment | can justify paying you. Upon your signed approval of this offer, | will forward
the full settlement to you immediately. I understand this offer is void if I do not send you $(AMOUNT) within
5-10 days of your signed confirmation.

If you agree to ""dismiss""” the judgment upon full and final payment of S(AMOUNT), then please sign and
return this offer and acceptance.

Offer Accepted and Agreed,

Re: Dispute of Collections Action: Case # {account_number}.

[If a collection agency has sent written notice, your case number is likely in the letter. If you have not
received a written notice from the collection agency, tailor this line accordingly. For example, show the date
you were contacted by the collection agency and/or identify the creditor by name if you can.]

To [person whose name appears on agency's notice to you]

On [date] | was contacted by [name of person who called you] of your agency, who informed me that
[name of collection agency] is attempting to collect [amount of claimed debt]. This individual is collecting
on behalf of [name of creditor]. [OR] This individual would not tell me for whom you are supposed to be
collecting.

[OR]

On [date] | received a written notice of the claimed debt, a copy of which is attached.

This is to inform you that I dispute the debt because [insert reason for dispute, e.g. the agency has
mistaken you with someone else or the debt has been paid. Include copies, not originals, of any
correspondence that support your dispute]. I am hereby requesting that you confirm the fact that I owe this
debt as required by any applicable state and federal laws. Please contact the creditor to obtain verification.
In addition, under the provisions of state and federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), Fair
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and related consumer statutes, I am hereby instructing you to cease
collection of the debt while efforts are made to obtain verification. Until you resolve this error with the
creditor, you should neither contact me nor anyone else except the creditor about this collection.
Furthermore, any reporting of this matter to credit reporting agencies is premature. Until you have
investigated my dispute, you should not relay negative information to a credit reporting agency. If negative
information has already been reported, you must notify the agency to remove said report until the
investigative process is over so that my credit report remains accurate, or at the very least, my credit
report should be updated to reflect my dispute.

‘Your next contact with me should be to either notice that the creditor has failed to provide verification of the
debt and that the matter has been closed or that you believe that this debt is valid and are providing proof
of my responsibility. If the former, please confirm that I am not being held responsible for the debt in writing
and also that if the account has already been noted on my credit report, that you will contact the bureau(s)
in question to have the account removed. If the latter, I expect that you will provide me with an explanation
as to why you have decided not to remove this account from collections and a copy of all documents
relevant to the debt such as the application, bills, records of communications and payments, and any other
data that indicates my responsibility.

I am instructing you not to contact any third parties such as my employer, neighbors, friends or family
members. In addition, you may not contact me by phone at work or at my home about this collection
activity. Al future correspondence should be sent to me in writing.

[If you wish to still speak to a collector by phone, indicate the times when it is okay to contact you or note
the name, address, and phone number of your attorney, if you have retained one.]

Please acknowledge that you have received this notice by [Pick a date that is two weeks from date of

Re: Account number: {account_number}

To Whom It May Concern:

This letter is to formally advise you that I believe your company has violated several of my consumer
rights. Specifically, you failed to validate a debt at my request, which is a FDCPA violation and you
continued to report a disputed debt to the Credit Bureaus: another FCRA violation. Not only have you
ignored my prior requests for validation of debt (proof attached: receipt copies or letter copies) but you
continue to report this debt to the credit bureaus causing damage to my character.

This letter will again request that you follow the FDCPA and please provide the following validation of debt
request:

-Proof of your right to own/collect this alleged debt

-Balance claimed including all fees, interest and penalties

-Contract bearing my personal signature

As you may be aware, ""Estoppel by Silence” legally means that you had a duty to speak but failed to do so
therefore, that must mean you agree with me that this debt is false. I will use the Estoppel in my defense.
I expect to receive the proof requested above within 15 days of this letter. Should you again ignore my
request for validation of debt I reserve the right to sue your company for violations of my consumer rights
as specified under both the FDCPA and the FCRA. I may also seek damages from you if warranted.

Dear Collection Manager:

It has come to my attention, through my credit report, that you claim I owe a debt to your agency. I can
save us both some effort and time by settling the debt out.

Here below is my offer. This is not a renewed promise to pay, nor does it constitute any agreement unless
you sign and return it.

Please Note that I have not yet agreed that this debt is indeed mine and I have the option to seek
additional proof of this debt from your agency.

Because you hold all the rights to report the debt to the credit bureaus as you see fit, you can certainly
change that listing at any time as the source reporting the debt.

I have no doubt that you are aware of my right to dispute this debt and request full proof of obligation.
Paying this unverified debt to you has little value to me if we cannot mutually agree that you will report the
debt as outlined below.

While I realize that your function is to collect debts as a collection agent, I am also aware that a paid
collection would not be favorable on my report. That being said, I have determined, through the bureaus,
that you have the absolute right to report this debt as you see fit or not report it at all.
If you indicate that you are unable to remove the negative listing on my credit report, | will be forced to
‘cease communication and request full verification of the debt.
My goal is to arrange a term that is acceptable to us both, since this debt is ""questionable.”

My Offer: I will pay your company the amount of $xx as “payment in full for the full satisfaction of this
account.” Upon receipt of the above payment, your company will agree to change this entry on my credit
reports to “Paid” immediately. You further agree to remove any and all previous notations of delinguency.
If you approve and agree to these terms, please acknowledge with your signature and return this letter to
me. You agree these terms herein are confidential and that you have the authority to make such decisions.
No payment will be made without written confirmation.

Upon receipt of this signed acknowledgment, I will immediately mail you funds by priority mail. This is not a
renewed promise to pay but rather a restricted offer only. If no terms can be met, no new arrangements will
be made, and the offer will be withdrawn.

Dear Collection Manager:

It has come to my attention through the credit bureaus that you claim I owe a debt to your agency. While I
have never had the debt verified to me as legitimate by your agency, I may be willing to save us both some
time and effort by ""settling the debt out™ with restrictions.

I understand that you hold all the rights to report the debt to the credit bureaus as you see fit and you can
change that listing at any time, as the source owning the debt. I am sure you are aware of my right to
dispute this debt and to request full proof of the obligation as per the FDCPA. Paying this unverified debt
means little to me if we cannot mutually agree that you will report the debt as mentioned below.

‘While I realize that your purpose is to collect debts as a collection agent, I am also aware of what a paid
collection on my report would represent for me, which is not favorable. That being said, I know that you
have the absolute right to report this debt as you see fit or not report it at all. It is only unlawful to report
false information but you may remove a listing any time at your discretion.

Please do not attempt to continue contacting me outside of this offer or I will be forced to cease and desist
‘our communication and request full lengthy verification of the debt. My goal is to arrange a term
acceptable to both.

My financial resources are limited and I am trying to do what's right but I am realistic about my financial
ability. I will pay your company the amount of S(AMOUNT) as “payment in full” for this account. Upon
receipt of the above payment, your company has agreed to delete the item on my credit reports.
If you agree with these terms please acknowledge this letter with your signature and return it to me. You
agree that the terms herein are confidential and that you have the authority to make such decisions. No payment will be made without written confirmation from you.
Upon receipt of this signed acknowledgment, I will immediately mail you a cashier's check by priority mail.
This is not a renewed promise to pay but rather a restricted offer only. If no terms can be met, no new
arrangements will be made and the offer will be void.

I have disputed this item with the credit reporting agency and they reported you confirmed the account as

In a good faith effort to resolve the matter amicably, I must demand proof of this debt, specifically the

Absent such proof, you must correct any erroneous reports of this past debt as mine.

2. What is your authorization of law for your collection of information?

3. What is your authorization of law for your collection of this alleged debt?

4. Please evidence your authorization to do business or operate in this state.

5. Please evidence proof of the alleged debt, including the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my
signature.

6. Please provide a complete account history, including any charges added for collection activity.
You have thirty (30) days from receipt of this notice to respond. Failure to respond in writing, hand-signed,

This letter is a formal complaint that you are reporting inaccurate and incomplete credit information. I am
distressed that you have included the information below in my credit profile and that you have failed to
maintain reasonable procedures in your operations to assure maximum possible accuracy in the credit
reports you publish.

Credit reporting laws ensure that bureaus report only 100% accurate credit information. Every step must
be taken to assure the information reported is completely accurate and correct.

The following information therefore needs to be re-investigated:

{dispute_item_and_explanation}

I respectfully request to be provided proof of this alleged item, specifically the contract, note or other
instrument bearing my signature. Failing that, the item must be deleted from the report as soon as
possible:

The listed item is entirely inaccurate and incomplete, and as such represents a very serious error in your
reporting. Please delete this misleading information and supply a corrected credit profile to all creditors
‘who have received a copy within the last six months, or the last two years for employment purposes.
Additionally, please provide the name, address, and telephone number of each credit grantor or other
subscriber.
Under federal law, you have thirty (30) days to complete your re-investigation. Be advised that the
description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information is
hereby requested as well, to be provided within fifteen (15) days of the completion of your re-investigation.

Re: Acct # {account_number}

To Whom It May Concern:

I am sending this letter to you in response to the notice I received from you on (date of letter). Please be
advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 (b) that your claim is disputed and validation is requested.

This is NOT a request for ‘verification’ or proof of my mailing address, but a request for 'VALIDATION'
made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your office provide me
with factual evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you.

Please provide me with the following:

-What the money you say I owe is for;

-Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe;

-Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe;

-Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable;
-Identify the original creditor;
-Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account,
-Show me that you are licensed to collect in my state; and

-Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent.

If your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the three major Credit Bureau's (Equifax,
Experian or TransUnion), said action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to
this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that
you represent I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following:

-Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act

-Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act

-Defamation of Character

If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested, I will require at least 30 days to
investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist.

Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my
credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel. This includes any information to a credit reporting
repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate when in fact there is
no provided proof that it is.

If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all
references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such
deletion request shall be sent to me immediately.
I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your offices to my home or to
my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not
limited to computer generated calls or correspondence sent to any third parties, it will be considered
harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in
writing and sent to the address noted in this letter.

This is an attempt to correct your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.

Kind regards,

Re: {account_number}

To Whom It May Concern,

I am in receipt of your letter claiming that I owe your company for a debt. According to the Federal Fair
Debt Collection Practices Act, I have a right to have the alleged debt validated by you.

I have to date, received no proof that I owe your company any debt and I am requesting that you forward
to me full and proper documentation as evidence of this alleged debt. As per the FDCPA, it is a violation
for any debt collector to pursue collection activity on an account without notifying the debtor in writing
within 5 days after any communication. Additionally I am allowed 30 days to dispute the validity of the
debt. If you are unable to provide me with proper proof then you must stop attempting to collect this
alleged debt.

If you continue to claim I owe a debt that you cannot confirm with proof then you will be in direct violation
of the FDCPA. Additionally, any attempt on your part to report this alleged debt to my credit reports will be
a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Please forward your documentation to me upon receipt of this certified letter. Please note that proper
documentation is not a print out or bill from you but rather actual proof of the debt's existence.

Re: Account number: {account_number}

To Whom It May Concern:

This certified letter, receipt number__________ is to formally advise you that I believe your company has violated several of my consumer rights. Specifically:

You failed to validate a debt at my request, which is a FDCPA violation and you continued to report a
disputed debt to the Credit Bureaus: another FCRA violation

Not only have you ignored my prior requests for validation of debt (proof attached: receipt copies or letter
copies) but you continue to report this debt to the credit bureaus causing damage to my character. This
letter will again request that you follow the FDCPA and please provide the following:

Validation of Debt Request

-Proof of your right to own/collect this alleged debt

-Balance claimed including all fees, interest and penalties

-Contract bearing my personal signature
As you may be aware, ""Estoppel by Silence” legally means that you had a duty to speak but failed to do so
therefore, that must mean you agree with me that this debt is false.I will use the Estoppel in my defense.

I expect to receive the proof requested above within 15 days of this letter. Should you again ignore my
request for validation of debt I reserve the right to sue your company for violations of my consumer rights
as specified under both the FDCPA and the FCRA. I may also seek damages from you if waranted.

To Whom It May Concern,

I received a bill from you on [insert date] and as allowable under the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, I
‘am requesting validation of the alleged debt I am aware that there is a debt from [name of doctor, hospital,
clinic, etc ] but I am unaware of the amount due and your bill does not include a detailed breakdown of any
fees.

Furthermore, I am allowed under the HIPAA law (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996) to protect my privacy and medical records from third parties. I do not recall giving permission to
[name of provider] for them to release my medical information to a third party. I understand that the HIPAA
does allow for limited information about me but any details may only be revealed with the patients
authorization, therefore my request is twofold and as follows:

Validation of Debt and HIPAA authorization

- Please provide a breakdown of fees including any and all collection costs and medical charges

- Please provide a copy of my signature with the provider of service to release my medical information to
you

- Immediately cease any credit bureau reporting until debt has been validated by me
Please send this information to my address listed above and accept this letter, sent certified mail, as my
formal debt validation request, of which I am allowed under the FDCPA.
Please note that withholding the information you received from any medical provider in an attempt to be
HIPAA compliant will be a violation of the FDCPA because you will be deceiving me after my written
request. I am requesting full documentation of what you received from the provider of service in
connection with this alleged debt.

Furthermore, any reporting of this debt to the credit bureaus prior to allowing me to validate it may be a
violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which can allow me to seek damages from a collection agent.
I await your reply with the above requested proof. Upon receiving it, I will correspond back with you by
certified mail.

RE: Account number {account_number}

To Whom It May Concern,

Please be advised that you are attempting to collect on an expired debt. I am invoking my right to cease
you, based on factual law that this debt in question is legally expired under the Statute of Limitations.
Accordingly, I am reguesting that you do not attempt to collect this expired debt, and should you seek legal
recourse I will invoke my right of the expired statute as a valid defense.

Additionally any attempts to harm my credit rating by updating or changing dates after you have been
informed that the debt is expired, are a direct violation of the FDCPA.

Any abuse to my credit rating on your part will be met with all recourse available to me.

I am aware of how long items may remain on my credit reports and any attempt to extend the reporting
time will be investigated by me, and reported to the American Collectors Association and my State
Attorney General.
I am completely aware of how long the debt is legally collectable and how long it is legally reportable. I
realize a debt is allowed to be reported to my credit for 7 years, and my research has shown me that often
a collection agency will reset the date of original charge off to the date they purchased it, thus trying to
extend the reporting time in an attempt to force a consumer into paying it. I am informing you of this
knowledge so that you may do the right thing.

I have no intention of renewing the expired statute of limitations, so please stop wasting your time
contacting me.

I expect this will be the last time I hear from you.

Re: {account_number}

To Whom It May Concern,

Please be apprised that you are in direct violation of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. In my opinion
you have violated at least three sections of this act by:
. Failing to validate a debt as allowed to the debtor under 15 USC 1692 (g) Section 809 (b)
. Communicating with a debtor after receiving a cease and desist certified mail under 15 USC 1692
(g) Section 805 (c)
. Harassment of alleged debtor under the ""abuse & harassment” subsection of the statute, USC 1692
(g) Section 806 (5)

I have complete and thorough records of your violations and I am prepared to protect myself and my rights
from unscrupulous collection agencies.
In (EXACT DATE), I sent by certified mail (receipt number: (CERTIFIED MAIL RECEIPT NUMBER), a
request for your office to provide me with proof and evidence of the debt you alleged I owed, and I did so
within 30 days of receiving your first notice. In that same letter I also included my cease and desist
instructions. 
After verified delivery of my letter (via your office’s signature), you proceeded to mail a simple bill which is
NOT considered a “validation of debt” by any means. You may wish to familiarize yourself with what is
required when validating a debt.
Your office also proceeded to contact me by phone after the delivery and acceptance of my certified letter.
Contacting a person after a cease and desist can lead to serious trouble for your agency including
damages of up to $1000.00 per incident.

I highly doubt that this S(ENTER AMOUNT OF DEBT) debt is worth your agency’s license and the fees
and penalties for violations of the FDCPA.

There is no question that you willfully violated my rights and that I could bring charges against you
immediately. However, I am assuming this has been a terrible mistake on your part and that you will take
appropriate steps to enlighten yourself and your staff of such dangerous actions.

I will also be checking my credit report to see if you have willfully reported an unverified and disputable
debt to the credit bureaus. If so, that will be a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I will state again in
this certified mailing that you have failed to verify the debt as accurate, you have provided no proof of this
alleged debt, and I must remind you again to not contact me in any way via phone or mail in reference to
collecting this debt.

If I receive anything other than absolute proof from you, provided by the original creditor, I will assume you
are harassing me and ignoring my cease and desist, and I will take action against you for these continued
violations and abuse.

Sincerely,

Re: Letter of Hardship

To Whom It May Concern,

I/We are requesting that Lender, Servicer, PMI, Governmental guarantor or insurer, representing lawyer, or
other party related to this case review my financial situation to see if I/We qualify for any workout option.
I/We are having problems making my monthly payments because of financial difficulties created by.
(Unemployment, Reduced Income, Divorce, Medical Bills, Too Much Debt, Death of my Spouse, Payment
Increase, Business Failure, Job Relocation, lliness, Military Service, Incarceration or Other - Please
Specify)

I/We believe that my/our situation is (Choose: Temporary / Permanent)

I have recently received a significant pay cut due to the current devastating economy. I used almost all of
my savings and it is getting more and more difficult to stay up to date on my mortgage payment. As a
result of the outlay in expenses and the bleeding dry of my money, I am struggling to make my mortgage
payments. Kindly consider my current situation and consider my request for a short sale. I had every
intention on making good on this loan, but at this time it does not like possible.
When I received this mortgage, my mortgage broker promised me a low fixed rate mortgage. When I arrived for the closing, my rate was relatively low; however, it was only fixed for a short time. At the closing
table, my broker told me the lender would refinance me in before the loan would reset and pressured me
into signing the loan documents. At this time, my rate has gone way up and I cannot get a refinance. There
is no equity in my home and the value has dropped tremendously. Please consider us for a short sale, as
'we see no other option make our housing payments affordable.

Thank you for your assistance and cooperation.

I/We, state the information provided above to be true and correct to the best of my/our knowledge
Sincerely,

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing this letter to explain our family's unfortunate situation that has caused us to become 
delinquent on our mortgage. We have tried everything in our power to keep current on our payments but
unfortunately since our interest rate adjusted, we have fallen behind and would like you to consider

working with us to reduce our monthly payments. I
The main reasons that caused us to become late are a decrease in our income, increase in our monthly I
obligations, current market conditions, our adjustable rate mortgage, and our inability to refinance.

I work as a waitress and my husband works at a marketing manager for a local screen printing company. I
Most of my income has been generated by tips and has decreased dramatically due fo the unfortunate

eeconomic situation. My husband job is secure and he has been with the same company for 2 years. We

have a 3 year old son and cannot afford daycare in order to get a second job.
For the past several months we have been cutting back on our misc. expenses. We no longer have
premium cable, go on vacations, or eat out Our credit cards are getting maxed out due to us paying our
mortgage on them and can no longer keep that up. We have currently missed 2 payments and wish to
work out a payment plan with you after you reduce our rates to something we can afford.
My husband and | consulted mortgage professionals regarding a refinance but due to our lack of equity,
the falling home prices in our community, and our lack of assets we were denied.

I have no other choice but to ask you to please consider my request for a loan modification. My family and
I would really be grateful if you can help us work out a payment schedule we could afford. We do not want
to lose our home. We wish to continue making mortgage payments on time for the remainder of our loan.
Sincerely,

Re: Loan Modification Request- 1st Mortgage Loan # (LOAN NUMBER).

To Whom It May Concern,

Enclosed with this package, you will find my loan modification request and supporting documentation for a
loan modification regarding loan number (LOAN NUMBER). After reviewing my income and the current
real estate market, you will find that my loan modification request is necessary. In my current situation, the
mortgage payments are not

affordable. However, with the proposed loan modification, I will be able to consistently make payments on
time and avoid a foreclosure. I would prefer to stay in my home, but if a modification is not possible I will
be forced into foreclosure.

Please review the enclosed documents outlining my overall financial situation and real estate market
conditions. You may contact me with any questions or requests for further documentation.

Sincerely,
